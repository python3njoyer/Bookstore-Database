# Data_Generator

Program to generate a fictitious dataset of user profiles. Can be used to populate a database with example data without exposing real user data. User attributes were inspired by the Barnes & Noble e-bookstore and include:
- a unique user ID
- first & last name
- email address
- password
- one of four security questions & response
